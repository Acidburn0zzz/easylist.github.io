Ads caused by malware or adware `extensions`_ or `plugins`_ on your computer will not be fixed by EasyList. If you arrived at this page for other reasons than curiosity about this blog, it is likely that a list author send you here because your computer is infected with such an extension or plugin. 

Please check all your extensions and plugins by disabling them one-by-one, restarting the browser each time after you did so, until the strange behaviour or ads are gone. In that case, the extension/plugin you disabled last is bad and should be removed. You can remove suspicious/unwanted extensions/plugins directly of course. Virus scanners often do not find such extensions or plugins! 

It's also **recommended to scan your computer** with any of these removal tools, even if you have found the responsible extension or plugin in the previous step to make sure there are no left-overs on your system: 

 * `AdwCleaner`_ 
 * `Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware`_ 
 * `Spybot - Search & Destroy`_ 


Also, to **prevent such issues in the future**: the next time you install an extension/plugin, consider if you really need it and if the site looks **trustworthy**. That will save you a lot of trouble in the future and likely keeps your browsing faster too. Apart from that, **always download software from the software developers' website**. Also, when asked so during the installation of any kind of software, do not install any additional toolbars, coupon notifiers, shopping widgets, etc. they offer.
