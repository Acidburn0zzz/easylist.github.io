I am pleased to announce that we have a new author for EasyList, EasyPrivacy and EasyList Germany: `Famlam`_. He has been a member of the `EasyList forum`_ for nearly a year and a half and is already a contributor to `AdBlock for Chrome`_, one of several advert blocking add-ons for Chrome that use the EasyList subscriptions. He was officially granted the status of EasyList author yesterday evening and I hope that you will welcome him into his new role.

I would also encourage anyone else interested in becoming an author for EasyList, EasyPrivacy or EasyList Germany to `contact the project`_. As I noted in a recent article on `EasyList usage and downloads`_, we have very few authors relative to the millions of users of the subscriptions and would be glad of additional assistance.
