There have never previously been formal policies for EasyList and EasyPrivacy, which made it difficult for contributors and, on occasion, authors, to suggest and add filters in a unified manner. This has now changed, with `the subscription policies`_ now publicly available on the website. While they may not account for every situation and some areas may be a matter of interpretation, it will help users to understand the decisions made by the EasyList and EasyPrivacy authors and should reduce the number of reports of content that is not covered to the subscriptions.

I would encourage all contributors to view the policies, especially new community members, as they may highlight important decisions taken by the authors; however, these policies are not set in stone and we are perfectly willing to discuss the decisions in `the EasyList forums`_.
