To be honest, it is for quite a while already but I somehow missed to announce it properly. 

`Liste AR`_, written by smed79 and Liste FR author Crits, has now become officially affiliated with EasyList and is also a recommended subscription for Arabic users. The subscription is listed on the `EasyList homepage`_, from where it may be `viewed`_ or `installed`_. 

It is recommended to use it together with `Liste FR`_. 

If you want to provide feedback about Liste AR, including reporting adverts or problems, please use the Adblock Plus issue reporter or open a topic in the `EasyList forums`_.
