Although EasyList author Khrin started to develop EasyList Italy just two weeks ago, it already has a considerable amount of filters and it is now ready to go live. The subscription is designed as a supplement for Italian-language websites and is now listed on the `EasyList homepage`_, from where it may be `viewed`_ or `installed`_.

If you want to provide feedback about EasyList Italy, including reporting adverts or problems, please use the Adblock Plus issue reporter or `open a topic in the EasyList forums`_.
