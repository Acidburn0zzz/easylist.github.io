`ABPindo`_ has now become officially affiliated with EasyList after considerable updates to the element hiding filers to improve efficiency. The subscription, which has been steadily developed since February of this year, is designed as a supplement for Indonesian-language websites and is now listed on the `EasyList homepage`_, from where it may be `viewed`_ or `installed`_.
