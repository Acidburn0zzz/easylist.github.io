`ChinaList`_ is a familiar subscription to many Adblock Plus users, being one of the oldest filter lists for the extension and recommended for Chinese language domains. Although the subscription was previously independent, they recently decided to switch to being a supplement to EasyList, at which point we approached the authors to discuss the possibility of affiliating with them. After a few minor adjustments in line with our policy, we are now pleased to announce the affiliation and that combination subscriptions are now available and listed on `our homepage`_.

If you want to provide feedback about ChinaList, including by reporting adverts or problems, please use the Adblock Plus issue reporter or submit suggestions in `their forum`_.
