Alex, the author of `Bulgarian list`_, has recently revamped his subscription by updating the filter syntax and checking almost every rule for redundancies. The EasyList authors have been very impressed by his efforts and the resulting subscription, and it has therefore become the first affiliated subscription not to use the EasyList forums. Bulgarian list is now listed on `the EasyList homepage`_, where it may be `viewed`_ or `added to Adblock Plus`_.

Furthermore, Bulgarian list has recently become `a recommendation in Adblock Plus`_, and will be selected by default for Bulgarian users of the add-on from version 1.3.2.

If you want to provide feedback about Bulgarian List, including reporting adverts or problems, please use the Adblock Plus issue reporter or submit suggestions via `the form on Alex's website`_.
