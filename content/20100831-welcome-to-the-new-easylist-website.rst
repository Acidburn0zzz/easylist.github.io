The EasyList website has been practically dormant for over a year, providing inaccurate information about the project and using a now superseded method of styling pages. The sub-domain has therefore been completely revamped over the summer and now contains entirely new content and coding. Among the many additions are a custom logo designed by `Peewee`_, German translations of the primary pages provided by MonztA, and EasyBlog. These changes permit greater communication and discussion with the community and, most importantly, end users.

Please let us know what you think of the new design in the comments section of the blog or by contacting the project at the `new e-mail address specifically for website feedback`_.
