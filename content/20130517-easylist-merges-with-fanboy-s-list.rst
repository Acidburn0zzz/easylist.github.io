The Easy team is very happy to announce today that both major ad blocking lists, EasyList and Fanboy's List, become one list! Also, EasyPrivacy and Fanboy's Tracking List were merged.

With this change all users will have a consistent Internet browsing experience and will no longer have to bother whether they have to choose EasyList or Fanboy's List or which one of them is better.

Fanboy, who has many years of experience in ad blocking, is a gain for the Easy project and will from now on be the main author. Welcome to the team!

Fanboy's Annoyance List was already included in the EasyList repository some weeks ago. Also, a new filter list solely for blocking social media integration, Fanboy's Social Blocking List, was created and is officially `featured on the Adblock Plus features page`_. It was adapted from the Annoyance List which means you do not need it if you already have Fanboy's Annoyance List. 

You do not need to do anything to get the new list(s), everything will be done automatically.  

If you encounter any issues, please `report them in our forum`_.
