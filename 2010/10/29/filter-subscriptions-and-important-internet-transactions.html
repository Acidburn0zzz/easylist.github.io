</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Filter subscriptions can occasionally cause problems on websites, with issues ranging from text failing to display to videos not playing. However, issues are a lot more serious if they occur on websites where important transactions take place, such as banking, shopping, or booking travel arrangements, where a blocked item has the potential to prevent an order from being received. Furthermore, it should be expected that there is a higher incidences of false positives on, for example, shopping sites. On domains of this nature people usually want to see adverts, as the promotions could be what is attempting to be purchased, and want to be tracked to ensure that the company receives an order correctly.</p>
<p>The only way that it can be guaranteed that an advert-blocker does not cause issues is by disabling it when making an important transaction. If using the Adblock Plus add-on this can be achieved by middle-clicking on the extension icon in the browser to disable it, with the same action being used to revert to the original state. Alternatively, domains visited regularly may be protected by the Adblock Plus filter <strong>&#64;&#64;||example.com^document</strong>, where <strong>example.com</strong> is the name of the important website. Although this may mean that users have to temporarily endure advertisements and tracking, the guarantee that an important order has been received correctly is something much more important.</p>
