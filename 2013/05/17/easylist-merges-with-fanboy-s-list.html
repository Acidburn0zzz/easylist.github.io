</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The Easy team is very happy to announce today that both major ad blocking lists, EasyList and Fanboy's List, become one list! Also, EasyPrivacy and Fanboy's Tracking List were merged.</p>
<p>With this change all users will have a consistent Internet browsing experience and will no longer have to bother whether they have to choose EasyList or Fanboy's List or which one of them is better.</p>
<p>Fanboy, who has many years of experience in ad blocking, is a gain for the Easy project and will from now on be the main author. Welcome to the team!</p>
<p>Fanboy's Annoyance List was already included in the EasyList repository some weeks ago. Also, a new filter list solely for blocking social media integration, Fanboy's Social Blocking List, was created and is officially <a class="reference external" href="https://adblockplus.org/en/features#socialmedia">featured on the Adblock Plus features page</a>. It was adapted from the Annoyance List which means you do not need it if you already have Fanboy's Annoyance List.</p>
<p>You do not need to do anything to get the new list(s), everything will be done automatically.</p>
<p>If you encounter any issues, please <a class="reference external" href="https://forums.lanik.us/">report them in our forum</a>.</p>
