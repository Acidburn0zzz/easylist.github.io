</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The basic principle of EasyList is that its &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://easylist.adblockplus.org/en/policy#easylist">filters must remove adverts</a>&quot;. However, several discussions, usually with website owners, have highlighted an obvious issue: &quot;advert&quot; has not been precisely defined. A <a class="reference external" href="http://forums.lanik.us/viewtopic.php?t=8578">topic was therefore opened</a> in the <a class="reference external" href="http://forums.lanik.us/viewforum.php?f=95">new EasyList policy forum</a> and culminated in the definition of an advert as &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://forums.lanik.us/viewtopic.php?t=8578#p34875">the promotion of third party content in return for goods or services</a>&quot;. This has several implications, as explained below.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>&quot;Promotion&quot;</dt>
<dd>Specifying that an advert must promote means that a factual link (e.g. &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://adblockplus.org/">Adblock Plus</a> is a Firefox add-on.&quot;) cannot be an advert as it lacks a marketing aspect. Furthermore, an independent review is also unable to be an advert because it critically examines all facets of the content, not just the positive aspects.</dd>
<dt>&quot;Third-party&quot;</dt>
<dd>The aim of a website is to entice people to read more of its content, which visitors presumably desire to do, as indicated by their presence on the domain; they should therefore not be hindered in doing so by a filter subscription. Whether websites are third-party or first-party (what happens if one person owns two domains?) is a question for the EasyList authors to consider.</dd>
<dt>&quot;... in return for goods or services&quot;</dt>
<dd>An important question that has been raised is whether an advert requires the exchange of money, to which I would respond that it is not an essential element. Money may be one of the goods supplied, but there may also be services provided in return. Therefore a link to, say, a web host would be removed if this is a sponsored link required as a provision of service, but not if the description is merely factual, as this would not be promotion.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This <a class="reference external" href="http://forums.lanik.us/viewtopic.php?t=8578#p34880">definition includes link exchange schemes</a>, whereby websites reciprocally exchange logos and links to the other domains for no other benefit, which Tarun, a website owner himself, claimed was not worthwhile removing given the large number of domains which use the link exchanges and their comparatively unobtrusive nature. After <a class="reference external" href="http://forums.lanik.us/viewtopic.php?t=8601">further discussion</a> it was agreed that, provided links exchanges are unobtrusive and free of any tracking parameters, they will not be specifically removed by EasyList.</p>
